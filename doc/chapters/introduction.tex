\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

The SpaceLab FlatSat Platform is a testbed for CubeSat PCB modules. FlatSats enable easier, faster and a secure method for testing subsystens independently while been integrated in a flat design before going to integration on a CubeSat form factor. The PCB can support up to 7 modules, all PC104 pins are interligated to flexibilize its use, only the particularity connection between modules need to be be taken into account. One PC104 has inverted pinout, the board also makes it possible to have two seperate power supplies, a UART to USB converter for 4 modules, kill-switches activation though SPDTs, Remove Before Flight (RBF) pin header, connector for charging batteries and SMA connectors for antennas. This project is to be used on the GOLDS-UFSC mission \cite{golds-ufsc} during test phase.
